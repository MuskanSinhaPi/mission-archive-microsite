If Cyberduck is also failing, let's just use rclone in Terminal instead — it's proven to work with R2 and skips all the Cyberduck authentication issues:
# Step 1 - brew install rclone

# Step 2 - Configure (just answer the prompts)
rclone config
When it asks questions type:

n → new remote
Name: r2
Storage: s3
Provider: Cloudflare
Access Key ID: paste from Cloudflare
Secret Access Key: paste from Cloudflare
Endpoint: https://16398f7a7c3062774db654b8a3cef0a0.r2.cloudflarestorage.com
Everything else: just press Enter to skip

Then upload:
rclone copy /Users/muskanshomef/Desktop/mission-archive-microsite/assets/images/gallery r2:cansat-assets/gallery --progress
